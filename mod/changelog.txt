changelog (v1.3):
order up can now be used while the user is digesting units to feed them to currently contained units (using order up on a teammate while digesting will stop digestion to still allow friendly units to be able to utilize order up's benefits, you'll just have to restart digestion manually whenver you do this)
wild lamia's jealous predator skill will no longer reduce the defense of safe units (i.e transporting / healing) until they start digesting

changelog (v1.2):
fixed chateau's order up dialogue
fixed massage being able to be used on a covenant that is currently healing
added another check to kiss to make sure that the user's containment period does not go into the negatives
reduced the amount of turns that kiss reduces the user's containment period (from 2 to 1)

added a separate folder for if you want lamias to be used in squad mode in the vanilla game


changelog (v1.1):
fixed wild lamia's bite not properly applying ko'd effect upon lethal damage, bite damage multiplier 1.5x > 1.35x, base accuracy 70% > 65%
fixed wild lamia's bite dialogue overriding the basic attack description
fixed wild lamia not having a face for her safe vore dialogue, modified dialogue slightly to compensate
modified lamia's safe vore / friendly fatal vore dialogue slightly

other changes:

fixed theano and lamia-type units not having skill -504 (responsible for most energy loss interactions)

lamia-type units can now be brought to 0-2 and 0-3 as playable units

added proper unique dialogue to lamia, wild lamia, and dusk lamia for getting safe vored by a carrrier and friendly fatal vore


currently known bugs:
pre-placed units in 0-2, 0-3, and sandbox will not have access to most of the new skills and effects (limitation of what I have access to since it's handled by the game in a way that I don't have access to)
some non-attack abilities (e.g. massage) will force incapacitated units to spit out units, this is a limitation of the current attack system

note:
most energy changes (i.e. max energy gain / cost reductions) were balanced in mind with the new energy drain system taking an additional 10 energy at the end of your turn
although I wanted to add it in, lamia-type units do not have dialogue when being digested by chateau's emergency relations due to a bug with the dialogue system being unable to handle lamia-type units in this situation
