hello this is crimson9715, creator of this mod for vessel tactics 0.03a called "vessel tactics+" (very creative name!!!)
this was mainly created for fun to see how units would perform if they had a few small tweaks to make them perform better overall (but also to learn the current systems of the game)
you can see what changes I made in "changelog.txt"
(note that this is not an official product so it may cause bugs / issues with the game, but it should be stable overall)

this was made via extracting the game's assets via unity asset ripper, then using dnspy to put edited code back into the game, you can find them here:
https://github.com/AssetRipper/AssetRipper
https://github.com/dnSpy/dnSpy


to install, put the contents of the folder named "mod contents" into the top layer of your installation of 0.03a (the .exe file should be on top)
there's also an optional folder called "thought edits" if you wish to experience 0-2 and 0-3 with the units that normally stand still to instead chase after you for an extra challenge (along with lamia in sandbox mode being able to chase after units that are out of her range)
easiest way to check if the mod is installed is to go to vessel details and check covenant to see if she has any new attacks

I've also included the source code of the mod (the contents of the Assembly-CSharp.dll file) under "source code", this lets you see the current edited contents of the original file (along with some already-existing code) if you're curious as to what I changed specifically or want to figure out how the code works yourself
there's also a bonus folder called "vanilla lamia addition" that's just the vanilla game, but with a patch installed to allow lamias to be used in vanilla if you don't want the new stuff


mainly looking for feedback, bug reports, or suggestions on what to change for this mod
